# Population Distribution Analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes the distribution of global population using the World Bank dataset (SP.POP.TOTL). The dataset contains total population values for countries across multiple years. 

## Objective
To create a clear histogram that shows how population is distributed across countries, helping identify patterns such as:
- How many countries fall into low, medium, or high population ranges
- Population concentration across regions
- Variations in global population sizes

## Dataset
Source: World Bank  
Indicator: SP.POP.TOTL (Total Population)

The dataset includes:
- Country-level population values
- Multiple years of population data
- Metadata for countries and indicators

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Output
The project produces a histogram that visualizes the distribution of population across all countries for the latest available year in the dataset. This helps in understanding the spread and skewness in global population.

## How to Run
1. Open the project folder  
2. Install required libraries:
   - pandas  
   - matplotlib  
3. Run the script `population_histogram.py`
4. The histogram will be displayed automatically

## Applications
- Understanding global demographic patterns  
- Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Academic and statistical visualization tasks  
- Comparing countries based on population ranges

## Conclusion
The histogram reveals that the majority of countries have medium to low population sizes, while only a few countries have extremely high populations, creating a highly skewed global distribution.
